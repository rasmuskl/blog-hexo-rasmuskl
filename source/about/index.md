My name is Rasmus Kromann-Larsen and I'm a danish developer blogging about the technical side of my life, mostly .NET stuff, but also fundamental topics like design patterns, principles and productivity boosters.

I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft.

In addition, I am a former core group member of the two largest .NET user groups in Denmark: [CNUG](http://www.cnug.dk) and [ANUG](http://www.anug.dk).
